### Research depth

Every project is facilitated by **concepts** developed through a process of **research**, **experimentation**, **design** and **production**.

### Creative excellence

We strive for industry excellence. Alway create work that stuns. Our work have earned us trust and recognition from awards, curators, commissions, exhibitions and workshops.

### Human-computer co-creation

We embrace automation with no-code and AI tools when possible and handcraft custom code where needed. In 2023, we are paying particular attention to AI tools as late 2022 has reached an inflection point where the role of digital technology has been transformed from being solely a *mediator* to a *co-creator*. We use these tools to create platforms for engagement, based on their ability to elicit the unique specificities of digital media in new and original way.

We campaign replicable workflows. This is the key to how we complete new work quickly, consistently and with high quality.
