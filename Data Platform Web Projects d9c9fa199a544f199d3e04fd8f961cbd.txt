ðŸ’¡ With years of professional experience in designing and developing enterprise-grade data-intensive web applications for large companies, start-ups and NPOs, I've earned a track record of bridging my technical and creative skills to build experiences that help people make sense out of large-scale data. My enthusiasm about building user-friendly data visualization platforms blends into my creative studio practice, where Iâ€™m broadly interested in exploring the use of digital technologies in making interactive data archives, visualizations, and experiences to facilitate public engagement with art, culture and history.
