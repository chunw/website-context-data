# Interactive Archive + Critical Investigation :: Multimedia Projects

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ Taking a socially-conscious approach to my creative pursuits, I engage with art as both a creator and a curator. I am broadly interested in archive making, the development of digital culture and community engagement. In the studio, I draw inspiration from news, sociology research and personal experience, creating works that reflect on contemporary cultures. I experiment with a symbiosis of techniques, selecting media that best suit the context of audience interaction: images and moving images, text, interactive objects and Web. With an investigative lens and a touch of surrealism, these works create tension among familiarity and estrangement which raise awareness and provoke dialogue.
